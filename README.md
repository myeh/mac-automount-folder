# mac-automount-folder
~~My own personal script to keep a network drive mounted~~
### I just use [autofs](https://www.google.com/search?q=mac+man+autofs) these days

~~Compile and save the applescript to a specific location, and update the launchd script.~~ ~~Copy the launchd script into \~/LaunchAgents and run the following to enable it~~

    launchctl load mount_video_folder.plist
